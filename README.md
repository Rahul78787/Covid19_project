Covid 19 Data Analysis Project Using Python:  COVID19 Data Analysis Using Python
Know the measures that your data sources need to be prepared for analysis
Know how to look at your data in order to find a reasonable way to base your analysis
Learn to visualize your analytical results

1) Importing COVID19 dataset and preparing it for the analysis by dropping columns and aggregating rows using pandas and numpy python library.
2) Deciding on and calculating a good measure for our analysis.
3) Merging eight datasets and finding correlations among our data.
4) Visualizing our analysis results using Matplotlib or Seaborn.

In this project, you'll learn how to pre-process and combine data sets to quantify and plan appropriate steps for an analysis. We will be working with the COVID19 India data set in this phase. We will analyse the following results
1) Total No of Covid-19 Corona Virus Patient in India
2) Total No of Covid-19 Corona Virus Patient in India State wise
3) Total No of Covid-19 Corona Virus Patient in India Gender wise
4) Total No of Covid-19 Corona Virus Patient in India Age wise
5) Total No of Covid-19 Corona Virus Patient in India City wise
6) Total No of Covid-19 Corona Virus Patient in India District wise
7) Total No of Covid-19 Corona Virus Patient in India Nationality wise
8) Total No of Covid-19 Corona Virus Patient in India Who Are Still Hospitalized
9) Total No of Covid-19 Corona Virus Patient in India Who Are Recovered Now
10) Total No of Covid-19 Corona Virus Patient in India Who Are Died


Role of Machine Learning to Predict the Outbreak of Covid-19 in India and MACHINE LEARNING PREDICTION FOR COVID 19 PANDEMIC IN INDIA is being implement by Simple Linear Regression using Machine Learning.
Predicting the Outbreak of COVID-19 Pandemic using Machine Learning is best way to get the total no corona virus patient in india which we get in future. We can also predict total no deaths due to this corona virus by using the same simple linear regression algorithm.


Machine learning algorithm implemented: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision TRess Regression,Random Forest Regression.
